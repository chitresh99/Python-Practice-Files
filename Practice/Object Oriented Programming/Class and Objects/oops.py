# Classes - Template it's like a blueprint
# For example - Lets say you want to bake cookies, so you will refer a recipe book
# so basically the recipe is the blueprint

# Objects - When you bake the cookies and get the cookies these cookies are instances of the class

# Example 2 - A railway form the railway form is the class which is the blueprint which has the boxes
# Which will help you fill the details

# objects - Here lets say your friends, and you fill out the forms those multiple forms are called instances

# DRY - Do not repeat your self that's what oops is based on
# This saves a lot of time
