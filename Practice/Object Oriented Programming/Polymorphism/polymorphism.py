# polymorphism is the ability to take various forms

# Let's take a boy as an example
# A boy is a son for is parent
# He is a friend for his friend
# He is a brother for his siblings

# Technical example

print(5 + 6)  # This is an example with int
print("5 + 6")  # This is an example with the string

# So the number 5 and 6 existed in multiple forms

# We can achieve polymorphism via super() and overriding
